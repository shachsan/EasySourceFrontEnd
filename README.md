# EasySource

[project](https://easy-source.herokuapp.com/)  |  [Demo](https://youtu.be/x1uVlIx_1HQ)

This was my solo project built during coding bootcamp at Flatiron school.

## About the App:

This app is about connecting buyers and wholesalers. Wholesale distributors can upload their products and buyers can browse
products, compare prices between vendors and order from the vendor of their choice(this feature hasn't been implemented but 
will be working on it).

## Technology used

The app was built using following technologies:

* Javascript ES6, Jquery
* Bootstrap, CSS, 
* Rails API

### `app features`

* Login/Logout
* Full CRUD
* Search and filter products
